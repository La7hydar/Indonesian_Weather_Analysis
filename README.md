# 🌦️ Indonesian Weather Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing weather conditions across multiple regions in Indonesia**, including **Surabaya, Baubau, Jakarta, Bekasi, Ponorogo, and Makassar**. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive view of regional weather patterns by combining temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, air quality, and rainfall probability data.

The dashboard-style visualization helps transform raw weather data into **clear, actionable insights** that can support daily planning, environmental awareness, and data-driven decision-making.
